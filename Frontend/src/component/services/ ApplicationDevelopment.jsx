            <p>
              Mobile web apps are useful alternatives to native apps for mobile devices. These days, Android-based products and iOS devices like the iPhone and iPad all come packed with fantastic mobile browsers (Mobile Chrome and Mobile Safari respectively), and Opera fans can install their preferred browser too.
            </p>
            <p>
              From a desktop point of view, these products make browsing just about the most pleasurable experience possible. CSS3 transitions, beautifully crafted HTML5 and embellishments mean their users get the highest possible browsing experience (assuming the content being viewed has been crafted with care and consideration).
